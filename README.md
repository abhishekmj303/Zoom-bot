# Zoom Bot

This is the bot used to join Zoom meetings by me ðŸ˜Ž, when online classes were going (Covid-19 ðŸ’‰)

## My Setup

I used Windows' built-in Task Scheduler as per my TimeTable to run,
- [Meet joining script](zoom_bot.py) 
- [Meet leaving script](zoom_bot_leave.py)
  
**PS:** This was back when I was tweaking and using Windows heavily.. Now I use Linux ðŸ¤“.

## Requirements

**pyautogui**:
```
pip install pyautogui
```
